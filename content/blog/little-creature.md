O Little Creature!  
Thou was frought forth fro the heart of earth.  
The sky is thy father and the earth is thy mother.  
O little creature!  
Thou shalt grow up and meet a lot of people,  
yet ye shall be old and pass away.  
So, happy art thou, O little creature!  
in the days of thy youth  
for nothing lasts for ever.  
But know thou, O little creature!  
whithersoever thou goest  
whithersoever thou beholdest,  
forget not that there is a day  
when thou shalt return whence thou comest.
